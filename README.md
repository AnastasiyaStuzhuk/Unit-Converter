# Unit-Converter:balance_scale:

Unit-Converter's the third solo project for [JavaScript course on scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). It's a simple project that used knowledge about objects, method addEventListener(), input value and template strings. We also considered the difference between function parameters and arguments and the difference between let and const variables. This project was created with all requirements. I also added some changes on hover for a button, shadows for some blocks and input field is cleared on focus.
