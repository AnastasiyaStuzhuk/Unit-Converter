# Unit-Converter:balance_scale:

Unit-Converter's the third solo project for [JavaScript course on scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). It's a simple project that used knowledge about objects, the addEventListener() method, input.value and template string. We also considered the difference between function parameters and arguments and the difference between let and const variables. This project was created by following all requirements. I also added some changes on hover for a button, shadows for some blocks and the input field is cleared on focus.
